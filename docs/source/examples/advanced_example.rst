Advanced Example
================

Advanced protein design workflow demonstrating JAX transformations.

Overview
--------

This example shows how to leverage JAX's performance features with PrxteinMPNN.

Code Example
------------

.. code-block:: python

   """Advanced PrxteinMPNN usage with JAX transformations."""
   
   import jax
   import jax.numpy as jnp
   from jax import jit, vmap
  

Performance Features
--------------------

* **JIT Compilation**: Faster execution for repeated operations
* **Vectorization**: Process multiple proteins simultaneously  
* **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized for large-scale protein design

Notes
-----

This example demonstrates the planned JAX integration features.
