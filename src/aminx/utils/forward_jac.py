"""Forward-mode categorical Jacobian, tiled over the tangent axis via xtrax.

The categorical Jacobian is ``J[i, a, j, b] = d logits[i, a] / d one_hot[j, b]`` --
shape ``(L, 21, L, 21)``.

Why this is tiled at all
------------------------
``jax.jacfwd`` is a ``vmap`` of JVPs over the *entire* tangent basis at once, and the
basis here has ``L * 21`` elements. Every one of those tangents carries a full set of
decoder activations, so peak memory scales with ``L * 21 * (per-tangent activation)``
rather than with the ``(L, 21, L, 21)`` output. At L=242 the output is a manageable
~103 MB while the unchunked activation footprint is on the order of 10^2 GB -- the
output was never the problem.

So the tangent axis is planned and dispatched through xtrax
(:func:`aminx.tiling.planner.plan_axis_strategy` +
:func:`aminx.tiling.dispatch.make_axis_dispatch_via_xtrax`), exactly as the candidate
axis is in ``sampling/mbr_consensus.py`` and the replicate/candidate axes are in
``sampling/conditional_logits.py``. Small proteins keep the full-parallel ``Vmap`` path;
larger ones are auto-demoted to ``SafeMap`` against the device memory budget. Per the
standing project rule (``using-xtrax`` skill, ``feedback_xtrax_composable_primitives``
memory), the chunking is **never** a hand-rolled ``jax.vmap``/``lax.map`` here.

This wires the axis template ``aminx.tiling.axes.N_JACOBIAN_PAIRS``, which was scaffolded
for exactly this purpose and left marked DEFERRED, and gives
``JacobianSpecification.jacobian_batch_size`` a real effect for the first time -- it was
previously declared on the CLI and the spec but referenced nowhere, so a user hitting an
OOM could set it and observe no change.

Numerical contract: the tiled result is the same computation as ``jax.jacfwd``, differing
only in the order JVPs are batched. ``tests/utils/test_forward_jac_tiling.py`` pins that
against the reference implementation kept below.

  ``ar_mask[i, j] == 1`` means position ``i`` SEES position ``j``'s sequence: the decoder
  gathers it into ``attention_mask`` and uses it as ``mask_bw`` to gate the *sequence*
  edge features, while ``1 - attention_mask`` gates the structure-only path
  (``model/decoder.py:144-147``). So an all-zero ``ar_mask`` admits no sequence
  information at all.

  This function exists because that is exactly what this module used to pass. With
  ``ar_mask = zeros``, the logits were a function of structure alone, their derivative
  with respect to ``one_hot`` was **identically zero**, and the categorical Jacobian came
  back as an all-zero ``(L, 21, L, 21)`` tensor -- correct shape, correct dtype, no error,
  no warning. The accompanying comment read "fully conditional / no autoregressive
  masking, every position sees every other", which is precisely backwards.

  ``1 - I`` matches the "full context minus self" default that
  ``inference/bundle_builder.py:227-228`` already documents and uses for
  ``mode="score_conditional"``. Self-exclusion is wanted here independently: ``J[i,:,i,:]``
  is self-dependence, not a coupling, and is dropped by every downstream reduction anyway.
