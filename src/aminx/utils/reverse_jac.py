"""Reverse-mode Jacobian implementation for efficient mutation scoring.

While forward-mode Jacobian (CatJac) computes sensitivity of *all* outputs
to perturbations, the reverse-mode gradient is much more efficient when we
only care about the gradient of a single scalar (e.g., the pooled log-likelihood
score). This allows computing the sensitivity of the score to all possible mutations
in a single backward pass.
