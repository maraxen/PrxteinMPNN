"""Inspect model encodings and features.

This module provides functionality to inspect and analyze the internal representations
of the PrxteinMPNN model, including node features, edge features, and (un)conditional
logits.

It includes functions to compute these features given protein structures and sequences,
as well as utilities to handle different decoding orders and conditioning strategies.

  """Orchestrate the model inspection process based on the provided specification.

  This function serves as the main entry point for inspecting model encodings and
  features. It coordinates the extraction of various internal representations from
  the PrxteinMPNN model, including:

  - Unconditional logits: Raw logits before conditioning on specific sequences
  - Encoded node features: Node representations after encoding the input structure
  - Edge features: Pairwise features representing relationships between residues
  - Decoded node features: Node representations after decoding operations
  - Conditional logits: Logits conditioned on specific sequence information

  The function also supports computing structural metrics such as distance matrices
  and cross-input similarity measures (RMSD, TM-score, etc.).

  Args:
    spec: Configuration object containing all parameters for the inspection,
      including input structures, features to extract, and output options.

  Returns:
    A dictionary containing the requested inspection results. Keys correspond to
    the feature types specified in `spec.inspection_features`, plus any additional
    structural metrics if requested.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the specification is invalid or incompatible options are provided.
    RuntimeError: If model loading or feature extraction fails.

  Example:
    >>> from prxteinmpnn.run.specs import InspectionSpecification
    >>> spec = InspectionSpecification(
    ...     inputs=["protein.pdb"],
    ...     inspection_features=["unconditional_logits", "edge_features"],
    ...     distance_matrix=True,
    ...     distance_matrix_method="ca",
    ... )
    >>> results = inspect_model(spec)
    >>> print(results.keys())
    dict_keys(['unconditional_logits', 'edge_features', 'distance_matrix'])
