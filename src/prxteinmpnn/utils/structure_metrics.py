"""Structural metrics and distance calculations for protein structures.

This module provides utilities for computing various structural metrics between protein
structures, including distance matrices, RMSD, TM-score, and similarity measures.
These functions are designed to work with JAX arrays and are compatible with JAX
transformations (jit, vmap, etc.).
