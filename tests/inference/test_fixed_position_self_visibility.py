"""No position may read its own slot through the ar_mask diagonal.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
Until 2026-08-27 every ar_mask constructor here set the diagonal. `generate_ar_mask`'s
untied branch was `row_indices >= col_indices` (non-strict); `generate_wave_ar_mask`
returns `earlier_wave | (same_wave & same_group)`, trivially true when i == j. The stated
rationale was that a not-yet-drawn position's own slot holds an inert placeholder.

That premise did not hold. `decode/autoregressive.py` initialized undrawn slots to token
index 0, and MPNN_ALPHABET is "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYX" -- index 0 is ALANINE, and the
unknown token X is index 20. `model/decoder.py:124` embeds it as
`one_hot_sequence @ w_s_weight`, a real nonzero row of a pretrained matrix. Because the
decoder gathers ar_mask into `attention_mask` to gate the SEQUENCE edge features
(`decoder.py:144-146`) and a residue is always among its own KNN neighbours (self-distance
0 is the global minimum), every position was fed the assertion "I am alanine" about itself
at the step it decided its own identity.

TWO INDEPENDENT REFERENCES DISAGREED WITH US, both verified against primary source:
  * LigandMPNN (dauparas), model_utils.py:227-231 + four more call sites:
        1 - torch.triu(torch.ones(L, L))        # triu defaults to diagonal=0
  * ColabDesign (sokrypton), colabdesign/mpnn/utils.py:19-26:
        jnp.tri(L, k=-1)[idx, :][:, idx]
Both are strictly triangular with a zero diagonal, preserved under any permutation.

Our own parity suite never caught it because `test_full_model_parity.py:90-95` hand-builds
its ar_mask with a STRICT comparison and passes it explicitly, so `generate_ar_mask` --
the function the production sampling path actually calls -- is never invoked there.

Measured downstream on TEV protease: mean JSD 0.0296 over designable positions between the
old and new masks, with an alanine-specific probability shift of -0.0049 against a mean of
0.0016 across the other twenty tokens.

SCOPE. Only the diagonal changes. Same-tie-group mutual visibility, and the
same-wave/different-group invisibility that gives the wave schedule its Jacobi
independence, are both preserved exactly. Whether tie visibility matches the reference's
tied decoding is a separate open question, deliberately not settled here.
