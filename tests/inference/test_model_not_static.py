"""RED tests for DEFECT 2: model arrays stored in static eqx fields.

The classes _VmapEncode, _ScanEncode, ConditionalDecode, UnconditionalDecode,
and AutoregressiveDecode all have:
    model: Any = eqx.field(static=True)

This causes Equinox to emit "A JAX array is being set as static!" warnings on
construction, AND places model weight arrays in the static partition instead of
the dynamic partition. This defeats filter_jit cache keys and silently prevents
in-place parameter updates from being seen by JIT-compiled functions.

These tests assert on the MECHANISM (partition membership, warning emission),
not on latency. They are deterministic and local.

After fix:
- model field should be dynamic (no static=True)
- No static-array warnings on construction
- Model arrays appear in eqx.partition dynamic side
