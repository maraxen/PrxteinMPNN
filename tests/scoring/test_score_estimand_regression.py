"""Regression tests for the two defects that made ``runner.score`` score the wrong thing.

Both defects were live on the default production path, both were silent (right shape, right
dtype, no error, plausible numbers), and neither was covered by any existing test. The
existing suite passed throughout because it exercises the *averaged* branch, which passes
``ar_mask=None`` and therefore already received ``build_inference_bundle``'s
``score_conditional`` default.

DEFECT 1 -- the AR mask included the diagonal. ``scoring/score.py`` built its mask with
``generate_ar_mask(decoding_order)``, whose untied branch is ``(row >= col)`` -- non-strict --
so ``ar_mask[i, i] == 1`` under every permutation. Since a residue is always among its own
KNN neighbours, the decoder gated that residue's TRUE one-hot into its own node update.
Measured on 1LVB chain A: +0.036243 nats (paired over 8 seeds, sd 0.002482, t = 41.3),
always in the over-confident direction, i.e. roughly 2.3x the effect sizes the score is used
to resolve. It also made the score key-dependent at ``backbone_noise=0``, because a fresh
decoding order meant a fresh mask.

DEFECT 2 -- the vocabulary was 20, not 21. ``_nll_from_logits`` sliced ``[..., :20]`` on both
factors, justified in-comment as excluding padding. Padding was never what it excluded: the
residue ``mask`` is already 0 at padded positions, which removes them from numerator and
denominator alike. The slice's one live effect was to charge exactly 0 nats for a *real* ``X``
residue while still counting it in the denominator. 1LVB carries six genuine ``X``
(selenomethionines), so this was not hypothetical.

The slice had a second, unrelated consequence: applied to a token-INDEX array it sliced the
only axis, yielding the first 20 *positions*, which then broadcast against ``(L, 20)``
log-probs whenever ``L > 20`` and produced a silently meaningless number.

  teacher-forced caller should be revisited. That change has now happened and the callers
  were revisited, so the assertion is inverted rather than deleted.

  What changed: the "undrawn placeholder" rationale for the set diagonal was false --
  undrawn slots held token 0, which is ALANINE, embedded as a real nonzero vector -- and
  both LigandMPNN (``1 - torch.triu(ones)``) and ColabDesign (``jnp.tri(L, k=-1)``)

  WHAT DID NOT CHANGE, and is the point of keeping this test here: score.py must still use
  :func:`full_context_ar_mask`. Its reason is now solely NON-CAUSALITY -- scoring a known
  sequence wants full context minus self, not a causal prefix -- and no longer has anything
