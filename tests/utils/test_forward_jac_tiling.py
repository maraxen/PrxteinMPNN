"""Parity + tiling tests for the xtrax-tiled categorical Jacobian.

The tiled implementation replaced an unchunked `jax.jacfwd`. The only thing that makes
that swap safe is that it computes the SAME tensor, so the load-bearing test here is
elementwise parity against the reference, at more than one tile size, including tile
sizes that do NOT divide the tangent count (`L * 21`), which is the case xtrax's SafeMap
raises on if the caller does not pad (backlog #4159).

Everything else -- axis ordering, the (i,a,j,b) contract -- is downstream of that parity.
An axis-ordering mistake here would produce a complete, symmetric, plausible tensor that
nothing downstream would flag, which is the same silent-corruption class as the coupling
orientation bug in asr's params loader.

  sequence information entered the decoder at all, so the logits were a function of
  structure alone and d logits / d one_hot was **exactly zero everywhere**.
